		      TODO List for TICHY

== Package ==

  If I try to install tichy on OM, I get several error :

    - python-pygobject package missing.

    - python-pygame package missing.

== Framework ==

   - Finish SMS application.

== General ==

  - Add an Evas backend for the gui.  I am already working on it, It
    is not totally working so far, but I am getting there I think.

  - Add clutter backend (This is not compulsory, but would be nice to
    have).

  - Also a ncurses backend could be cool.

  - Have a way to tag Items as 'debug', The 'debug' items are only
    registered in debug mode (or via the configurations maybe).

== Marketing ==

  - Make a website, with a wiki, news, screenshots, and the
    documentation.

== Look & Feel ==

  - Get more icons (specially for the sections in the config plugin)
    The icons from tango desktop are actually not too bad...

  - Let guip and guic widgets be able to get there size from the style.

  - Find a proper font, that has chinese characters.

  - Redo the keyboard. It is unusable as it is now : too small, too
    slow !! I am working on it a little. The keys are big enough now,
    it is still too slow.

== re-factoring ==

  - replace 'expandable' attribute by 'expand', to follow gtk.

== guip and guic ==

  - Create a few new widgets (controls, alignment, spins).

  - Label.optimal_size should be automatically computed when we change
    the text. For the moment I do it a very stupid way (see the label
    implementation).

  - Put Box.border, Box.space in the style (may need some more work
    first).

== code quality ==

  - Add more comments. Choose a style for the docstrings (I remember a
    nice python PEP on this).

  - Have the doc autogenerated.

  - Add a way to test the plugins : What I would like to have is a way
    for every plugin to define some unittest, the test would be run on
    start only if we start tichy in debug mode.

  - Add automatic code style testing with git. Refuse any commit that
    doesn't have the proper style. (Could be great to force every
    public function to have a comment as well !)
