                           TICHY CONF FILES

Tichy will try to load configuration files in three locations, in this
order : ./tichy.cfg, /etc/tichy/tichy.cfg, ~/.tichy/tichy.cfg.  The
files are in format used by python ConfigParser library.

The local file should contains default values for running tichy
locally, the system file should contains default values for running
tichy once installed.

The current possible sections and values are :

  [plugins]

    path:
       
       the directory where tichy should look for plugins


   [services]

     defaults:

        A comma separated list of <service names>:<item names>. This
        is useful for selecting testing services for development. For
        example to use the testing service for gsm and sim :
 
           defaults = GSM:Test, SIM:Test
