			    Tichy debuging

In case of bug:

  If there are some bugs in tichy, the first thing to do is to trace
  the loggins. By default tichy print logging info to stderr output
  and in the file /tmp/tichy.log. The entries in /tmp/tichy.log are
  more verbose than the one on stderr.

  if you think that something is going wrong please send an email to
  Guillaume Chereau <charlie@openmoko.org>

  If the problem seems to be new, you can check the git logs and try
  to track down the commit that introduces the error.


Profiling tichy:

  Tichy is quite slow. Many optimization may be done. So far I didn't
  really care, I prefer to have a clean design than a fast one.

  To profile tichy we can use python profiler module.
